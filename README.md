# EWA-m-for-Dependent-Tasks-Offloading-Problem-in-Multi-edge-Cloud-Computing
implemented an Enhanced Whale Optimization Algorithm (EWA) for dependent task offloading in a multi-edge cloud system. With Frame Shifting and Load Redistribution, EWA improves latency, energy use, and cost—reducing them by 22.84%, 78.28%, and 61.47% over WOA—showing its efficiency for MEC environments.
